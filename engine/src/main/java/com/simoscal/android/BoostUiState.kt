/**
 * The boost editor's screen state and every transition it can make — pure.
 *
 * The editor is deliberately *staged*: a drag moves a [draft], and only Apply
 * turns that draft into one journaled engine op. A fingertip sliding across
 * twelve breakpoints would otherwise commit dozens of edits, and an undo history
 * where one gesture is fifty entries is a history nobody can reason about — on a
 * bin that gets flashed to a real ECU.
 *
 * Everything here is a plain function of state, so the rules can be pinned on the
 * JVM. The view model adds only the bridge calls.
