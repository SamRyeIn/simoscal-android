 * [SlotColors]). Only the active slot is drawn at full strength and only it
 * responds to a drag — the others are ghosted context, because a fingertip that
 * could land on any of five overlapping curves would sometimes move the wrong
 * one, and the wrong one here is a boost table.
 *
 * Two limits are drawn, and they are not the same limit (see [BoostCurveModel]):
 * the solid ceiling line is the per-rpm base cap, above which a slot has no
 * effect; the dashed line is the scalar value the engine outright refuses at.
 * The shaded band between the ceiling and the top of the plot is the region
 * where an edit is accepted but changes nothing.
 *
 * The caller owns the height and must give one — a fixed height upright, the
 * leftover of the column in landscape. The plot is the thing a person drags a
 * boost number out of, so how tall it is drawn is a decision for the screen
 * that knows how much room there is, not a constant in here.
