 * **Always a `.` decimal separator.** `String.format` uses the *default* locale,
 * so on a comma-decimal phone a value shown as "10,50" is fed straight back into
 * a text field whose only parser is `toDoubleOrNull` — which rejects it, leaving
 * the Set button permanently disabled. Every number that can round-trip through
 * the UI, and every number quoted in a refusal message next to one, goes through
 * here.
 *
 * **Never scientific notation.** `%g` switches to an exponent below 1e-5, which
 * is how a y-axis breakpoint of exactly 0 °C came to be displayed as
 * `4.40536e-13`: the XDF's scaling equation is evaluated in floating point, and
 * the residue is the arithmetic's, not the calibration's. An exponent on a
 * calibration screen is therefore never information — it is either noise dressed
 * up as a number, or a real value made unreadable. Fixed point shows the noise as
 * the zero it is.

/**
 * One display precision, chosen for a whole set of numbers and applied to all.
 *
 * Precision is a property of the *set*, not of each number: a grid whose cells
 * are individually formatted has a ragged right edge and invites reading two
 * differently-rounded cells as differing by more than they do. So a table's
 * cells share one format, and each axis gets its own — they are different
 * quantities and there is no reason for an rpm ladder to carry a lambda grid's
 * decimals.
 *
 * The precision is picked to show roughly four significant digits of the largest
 * value present, which is what puts a 1/4096-quantized `3.100098` on screen as
 * `3.100` and a `79.9891` breakpoint back as the `80` the calibrator meant.
 *
 * It is then *raised* until every meaningfully different value in the set formats
 * differently. That guard is the reason rounding here is safe: the editor shows a
 * changed cell above its old value, and two genuinely different numbers that
 * render identically would turn a real edit into an invisible one. Differences
 * below one part in a billion are excluded from that test — those are the
 * float-arithmetic residue described above, not edits.
