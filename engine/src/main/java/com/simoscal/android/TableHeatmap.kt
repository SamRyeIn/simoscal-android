/**
 * Value → colour mapping for the calibration grid.
 *
 * Deliberately outside the `ui` package and free of Compose types so it can be
 * tested on the JVM, the same split [BoostPlotScale] uses.
 *
 * A calibration table is a *surface*, and a grid of bare numerals hides its
 * shape: a ramp that sags in the middle, a cell somebody fat-fingered an order
 * of magnitude, a row that does not follow its neighbours. Colour makes those
 * legible at a glance, which is why every desktop tuning tool paints its maps.
 *
 * The scale is per-table and relative, taken from the values on screen. There is
 * no absolute palette to use instead: this grid shows boost in hPa, lambda,
 * timing in degrees, and raw axis breakpoints, and no fixed value→colour mapping
 * spans those. Relative shading answers "where is this table high and low", which
 * is the question the shape is being read for. It cannot answer "is this value
 * large in absolute terms" — read the numerals for that; they are always drawn.
