/**
 * The per-slot switchboard: sixteen scalars against five map slots.
 *
 * The switch patch's whole proposition is one shared tune plus a per-slot
 * decision about which features are on. That decision is *comparative* — "which
 * slots have launch control enabled" — and a table-at-a-time editor answers it
 * badly: you open five tables, and the one you did not open is the one that
 * surprises you in the car. So the engine reports every setting against every
 * slot in one read, and this renders it as a grid.
 *
 * Unlike the table and boost editors, edits here are **not staged**. A flag is
 * one byte with two states and no shape to review before committing; a draft
 * would add an Apply step that reviews nothing. Each toggle is its own bridge
 * call, its own journal entry, and its own undo point.
