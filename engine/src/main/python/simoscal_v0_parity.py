"""V0 feasibility-gate parity payload — one module, run identically on host and Android.

The V0 go/no-go asks a single question: **does the already-trusted ``simoscal``
engine produce byte-for-byte and field-for-field identical results when embedded
in an Android app via Chaquopy?** This module is the answer's only source. Both
the host runner (``parity/run_host_parity.py``) and the Android
instrumentation harness import *this file* and call :func:`run_parity`, so the
two sides cannot drift by running different code.

The contract that makes the comparison meaningful:

* Every number that crosses into the report is formatted through :func:`_f`
  (``%.17g``) so a float round-trips exactly rather than through ``repr``
  platform variance.
* The report splits into a **compared** part and an **informational** part.
  ``environment`` and ``timings`` are informational by construction — the Python
  build, ABI, and wall-clock are *expected* to differ between a Mac and a phone,
  and comparing them would fail the gate for the wrong reason. Everything else
  is compared, and :func:`parity_digest` reduces it to one sha256.
* Nothing here writes to the source bin. Edits stage in ``CalFile``'s in-memory
  buffer and are saved into a caller-supplied work directory, so the parity run
  itself upholds the immutable-source rule the rest of the pipeline depends on.

Why these particular operations: they are the narrowest set that still crosses
every layer the phone has to get right — XML parsing at 5.8 MB, numpy decode
math, the checksum implementation (integer-exact), the minimal-diff writer, and
the psi→hPa floor that the boost ceiling depends on. If all five agree, the
engine is portable; if any disagrees, a piecemeal port would inherit the same
disagreement.
