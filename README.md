# simoscal for Android (V0 parity gate + V7 shell + V8 editors + V10 changes)

Implements **V0**, **V7**, and **V8** of
`docs/2026-07-21-002-feat-simoscal-android-v1-plan.md`: first prove the
Python engine runs under Chaquopy with **byte-for-byte parity** against host
Python, then build the Compose shell that drives it. Nothing here flashes an
ECU, and nothing here does bin math in Kotlin.

## This repository

This app was split out of the `simoscal` library repo on 2026-08-18, ahead of
opening `simoscal` to beta testers. It keeps a **cross-repo dependency**: the
Kotlin side talks to the Python engine over `simoscal/bridge.py`, which lives in
`SamRyeIn/simoscal` and is not vendored here. To build, check `simoscal` out
alongside this repo and point the Chaquopy `pip` install at it.

`docs/` holds the design record that moved with the app: the requirements
brainstorm, the two plans, the implementation-details log, and a full copy of the
`simoscal` code-review log as it stood at the split (the library half of that log
also continues in the `simoscal` repo).

## V7 — the Compose shell

The app lives in **one module**, `:engine`, alongside the Chaquopy runtime. That
is not tidiness lost: Chaquopy's Gradle plugin applies to the *application*
module, so a separate `:app` would have to either carry its own Python runtime or
demote `engine` to a library Chaquopy does not support. Keeping one module also
leaves the V0 parity evidence (taken against `applicationId com.simoscal.engine`)
describing the same artifact the UI ships in.

UI code is `com.simoscal.android`; the V0/V6 engine plumbing stays in
`com.simoscal.engine`.

| File                    | What it is responsible for                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BridgeProtocol.kt`     | Envelope build/parse; version and call-identity checks. Pure.     |
| `BridgeClient.kt`       | Suspending front door; cancellation never aborts an in-flight op. |
| `ImportStore.kt`        | SAF URI → app-private content-addressed copy, hashed while streaming. |
| `EditorState.kt`        | Every gate rule, as pure data. Where the safety invariants live.  |
| `EditorViewModel.kt`    | Sequences bridge calls; persists recovery after each mutation.    |
| `RecoveryStore.kt`      | DataStore pointer wrapping the engine's own session record.       |
| `ShareBin.kt`           | FileProvider grant; takes a `Verified` build and nothing else.    |
| `BoostCurve.kt`         | Boost read model + the two ceilings and every clamp. Pure.        |
| `BoostUiState.kt`       | Staged boost draft, the stepper's selection, and every transition. Pure. |
| `BoostPlot.kt`          | Canvas coordinate math, Compose-free so it is JVM-testable.       |
| `AnalysisModel.kt`      | The `analyze_logs` read model. Parses; never analyses. Pure.      |
| `AnalysisPlot.kt`       | Analysis axis/tick/thinning math, Compose-free. Pure.             |
| `AnalysisUiState.kt`    | Picked logs, the run gate, and the stale-report rule. Pure.       |
| `AnalysisViewModel.kt`  | One bridge call; no session, no bin, nothing to recover.          |
| `TablesUiState.kt`      | Catalog, table draft, selection, and batch operations. Pure.      |
| `ChangesUiState.kt`     | The session's journal as flat text, and what needs a reviewer's eyes. Pure. |
| `ui/`                   | Compose shell, navigation, and the six screens.                   |

### The rules the shell enforces

- **No "continue anyway".** A blocked preflight renders a dialog that cannot be
  dismissed by back-press or outside-tap, offering only *Choose another bin* and
  *Cancel*. Both retract the verdict; neither opens a session, because
  `canOpenSession` requires `PreflightState.Passed`.
- **Export exists only in the verified state** — absent, not disabled. Any edit,
  undo, or redo invalidates a completed build (`invalidatingBuild()`), so a
  Share button can never point at a candidate bin that predates the current
  journal.
- **A gate that did not run is not a pass.** `GateResult.ran` is rendered as its
  own third state.
- **No permissions.** Enforced by `verifyDebugNoPermissions`, which reads the
  *merged* manifest — so a permission contributed by a library fails the build
  too — and is wired into `check`.
- **A stepped edit is a typed edit.** Plus and minus route through the same
  validation a typed value gets (`nudgingSelection` → `withTypedPoint`), so a
  press that would cross the refusal ceiling or go below zero is *refused with
  its reason* rather than clamped onto the limit. A drag is the one input that
  clamps, because a fingertip is an approximation and a keystroke is not.
- **One set of controls, all shown.** There is no Simple/Advanced switch: file
  hashes, gate detail lines, the engine's error detail, Restore, and the shared
  rpm-axis editor are on screen for everyone. A control worth hiding from a
  person editing a real ECU bin is one that should not ship.

### Rotating is a layout decision, not a mode

Landscape is the boost editor's own view: the shell drops the top bar (it holds
only the wordmark), and `BoostScreen` swaps its scrolling column for a
non-scrolling one where the canvas takes `weight(1f)` and the slot chips, the
intent line, one status line, and the button row take the rest. Nothing about
what is *permitted* changes with orientation — the same `canX` rules gate the
same actions — and the controls landscape leaves out (copy-from, the receipt,
the shared-axis editor) are all still there when the device is upright.

### The look is the promo video's, from one palette

The app and `Docs/promo/`'s two cuts are the same product seen twice, so they are
painted from one list of colours rather than two that drift. `PromoPalette`
(`ui/Theme.kt`) is a transcription of `PALETTE` in `Docs/promo/config.py` — same
names, same eleven RGB triples — and `res/values/colors.xml` repeats the two the
platform needs before Compose exists. The video is built from the library's real
output and is the older of the two, which makes it the source: add a colour there
first.

What that buys, beyond looking of a piece:

- **The names are roles, and the roles are enforced by use.** `accent` is boost,
  heat, and the thing that changed — a staged proposal, an applied edit, a
  changed cell, the live slot curve. `accent_2` is verification and selection.
  `good`/`warn`/`danger` are a check that passed, something to read first, and a
  refusal. `PanelTone` is that vocabulary as a type, so a panel picks a meaning
  rather than a colour.
- **One scheme, always dark, no Material You.** `dynamicColorScheme` would repaint
  the app in the device wallpaper's hues, which is exactly wrong here: it would
  make "the engine refused" a different colour on every phone. The light scheme
  and the `darkTheme` parameter are gone with it — `SimoscalTheme` takes only
  its content.
- **Numbers are monospace, everywhere.** `PromoType.identifier` and
  `figureSmall` carry the video's Menlo-set figures across to grid cells, axis
  breakpoints, bin names, hashes, and the encoded-value receipt. A filename
  differing by one revision digit and a column of psi figures are both read
  glyph-by-glyph, which a proportional face makes harder for no gain.
- **Panels are flat and hairlined, not raised.** `Panel` replaces Material's
  `Card` throughout: `bg_alt` fill, a 1 dp `rule` border, no elevation. Every one
  of them is a readout — what the bin holds, what a gate found — and a raised
  surface implies a thing to pick up rather than a face to read.
- **The five slot colours are the video's `SLOT_STYLE`.** `BoostCanvas`, the slot
  chips, and the switchboard's column headings all draw slot *n* in the same hue
  the promo's slots beat draws it in, so "slot 4" means one thing across the app
  and the video both.

Two places deliberately did **not** move to the palette. The heatmap ramp
(`TableHeatmap.kt`) still runs deep blue → cyan → green → amber → red, because it
mirrors the ramp the library's own compare plots use — the ones the video itself
shows — and repainting it here would put the app and the report at odds. And the
launcher icon is generated, not hand-drawn: `Docs/promo/gen_app_icon.py` renders
it from the same palette into `res/mipmap-*/`.

The window background is set in `themes.xml` as well as in Compose. On a build
that starts a Python runtime, the gap between the launcher tap and the first
composed frame is long enough to see, and on the stock light parent it was a
white flash before a near-black app.

**How much of the repaint has been seen running (2026-08-19).** Every screen has
now been driven on the target device — a Galaxy Tab A9+ (`SM-X210`, Android 16,
1200x1920 at 240 dpi) over adb — and screenshotted against the promo stills.
Import and the passed-preflight verdict were checked on the `v0_arm64` emulator
on 2026-08-17; **Tables, the table grid, Boost, Slots, and Build** were checked
on the tablet on 2026-08-19.

What held: the wordmark and its orange `cal`, tracked kickers over bold headings,
flat hairlined panels, table IDs in mono over descriptions in italic prose,
squared accent buttons, and the five `SLOT_STYLE` hues reading the same in the
boost canvas's curve labels, the slot chips, and the switchboard's column
headings. The heatmap grid switches cell text between light and dark by cell
luminance, so the cold blue end stays legible — the one interplay the emulator
run could not check.

Three defects the screenshots caught, all fixed in the same pass:

- `BoostCanvas` drew the `rpm` unit label and the last rpm tick label on the same
  baseline, both anchored to `geometry.right`, so they overprinted into an
  illegible blot at every canvas width. `rpm` now sits top-right, mirroring `psi`
  top-left.
- The ceiling legend fenced `IP_PUT_SP` in literal backticks, which nothing
  parses. `Caption` gained an `AnnotatedString` overload and `IdentifierSpan`, so
  a parameter ID sets in mono inside a sentence of prose.
- The "N breakpoints ... will have no effect there" caption was painted `Danger`.
  That is the *swallow* case, not a refusal, so it is `Warn` now — the same
  distinction the function's own doc comment draws.

Reaching the session screens is cheap on real hardware and expensive on an
emulator: resuming a saved session opened in about 15 s on the tablet, against
roughly four minutes per XDF parse on `v0_arm64`, where an earlier attempt was
killed by the emulator running out of memory partway through. Drive the tablet,
not the emulator.

Still no Compose screenshot tests, so none of the above is guarded against
regression — the gap V8 already records, and the reason three rendering defects
survived to a hand-driven pass.

### Why DataStore rather than Room

There is exactly one recovery record, with no relations and no queries. The hard
half of recovery is the engine's (`session_serialize` / `session_recover`); the
app only stores that record plus verified pointers to the input files. Room would
add an annotation processor to persist a single JSON string. Revisit at Phase 2
if projects and revision lineage arrive.

### Verifying V7 on this machine

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
./gradlew :engine:testDebugUnitTest :engine:verifyDebugNoPermissions \
    -Psimoscal.dir=/Users/sam/SimosTools/Code
```

JDK 17 is not a preference: 11 fails with `invalid source release: 17`, and
Android Studio's bundled JDK 21 fails AGP 7.4.2's `JdkImageTransform` in
`jlink`. `-Psimoscal.dir` is needed because the Chaquopy `pip` install defaults
to `../../simoscal` and the library actually lives inside the car-tuning repo
at `SimosTools/Code`; `SIMOSCAL_DIR` in the environment does the same job.

Expect **226 unit tests passing** and a receipt at
`engine/build/reports/permissions/debug.txt`:

| Test class            | Cases |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| `AnalysisModelTest`   | 18    |
| `AnalysisPlotTest`    | 11    |
| `AnalysisUiStateTest` | 14    |
| `BoostCurveTest`      | 18    |
| `BoostPlotTest`       | 7     |
| `BoostUiStateTest`    | 22    |
| `BridgeProtocolTest`  | 13    |
| `ChangesUiStateTest`  | 16    |
| `FormattingTest`      | 15    |
| `ImportNamingTest`    | 9     |
| `NumpyPinTest`        | 1     |
| `EditorStateTest`     | 23    |
| `SlotsUiStateTest`    | 12    |
| `TableHeatmapTest`    | 18    |
| `TablesUiStateTest`   | 24    |
| `VerifiedParamsTest`  | 5     |

Keep these current. The total is this document's stated pass criterion, so a
stale number cannot distinguish a complete run from a partial one. The figure has
now gone stale three times: 93 → 109 when the 2026-08-14 review fixes added
cases without updating it (CR-20260815-03), 109 → 158 when V8/V9's own suites
landed the same way, caught while re-running the gate for the 2026-08-17
repaint, 158 → 159 when the 2026-08-18 split moved `NumpyPinTest` here from
`simoscal` without updating the total, and 159 → 167 again before V10 (nine cases
added to `BoostUiStateTest`, one retired from `EditorStateTest`, neither
recorded) — found by diffing this table against the run rather than by anyone
noticing. V10 takes it to 183, and V11's analysis suites take it to 226. If you add a test, add it here.

The unit tests are deliberately JVM-only and cover the pure layers: the envelope
contract against the real `org.json`, every state gate, the import naming and
hashing rules, and the file-param key names. They need no device.

> **They do not cover the Kotlin → Python boundary itself.** The two halves agree
> on an envelope contract *and* a params contract; only the first was tested
> until `VerifiedParamsTest`, and the gap hid a defect that broke every
> file-naming op from V7 until 2026-08-15 (CR-20260815-01). A green JVM suite is

`./gradlew :engine:assembleDebug` builds the whole APK (Compose + Chaquopy).
Measured 2026-08-16, both configurations built back-to-back from the same tree:
**60.8 MB** for arm64 + x86_64, **50.3 MB** for the arm64-only build that now
ships. Dropping the ABI is worth 10.5 MB — not just the 10.3 MB of `lib/x86_64`
`.so` files, because Chaquopy also ships per-ABI Python assets
(`stdlib-x86_64.imy`, `requirements-x86_64.imy`, `bootstrap-native`). An earlier
note here estimated an arm64-only split at "~30 MB"; that was a guess, and the
measurement above replaces it. V8 adds no dependency and did not move the
number. The `material-icons-extended` artifact cost 5.4 MB on its own for three
glyphs, so the navigation bar uses `material-icons-core` instead.

> **`lintDebug` is not a meaningful gate here.** AGP 7.4.2's lint bundles a
> Kotlin 1.7.1 UAST analyzer, and the project compiles with Kotlin 1.9.24, so
> lint emits `Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin` and its
> Kotlin *source* analysis does not run. It still checks Gradle, manifest, and
> resources (currently 18 warnings, all deliberate pins or targetSdk 33). Do not
> read a clean `lintDebug` as a statement about the Kotlin code.

### What V7 still owes, and why it needs hardware

None of these have a host-side substitute; they are listed rather than claimed:

- ~~the SAF picker~~ — **done 2026-08-15**: picked the real bin and both XDFs
  through DocumentsUI on a Galaxy Tab A9+ (`SM-X210`, Android 16, `arm64-v8a`),
  and preflight returned *"Ready to edit — recognised SC8S50 bin with valid
  checksums"* against the R14 patched bin, both embedded checksums clean;
- the share hand-off to SimosTools with the real bin;
- airplane-mode import → edit → export;
- process-death recovery during copy, edit, and build;
- rotation and low-storage behaviour;
- **tablet layout** — the shell renders as a phone-width column on a 1200 px
  tablet, leaving most of the screen empty. The v1 plan deferred tablet layout as
  a phone-first call; the actual target device is a tablet, and SimosTools runs
  on the same one, so the whole loop closes there.

That first item is the one worth reading twice: reaching it took a one-line fix
(CR-20260815-01), because *no* file-naming op had ever succeeded on any device.
Everything above the line in this README was true of code that could not be
reached from the UI.

## V8 — the boost canvas and the calibration editors

### Two ceilings, not one

The single most important thing in this unit. `min(base ceiling, slot)` produces
**two different limits**, and the editor draws both because conflating them
would either block edits the engine accepts or forward edits it rejects:

| Limit                                | What it is                                                        | In the UI                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `BoostCurveModel.baseCeilingPsi`     | `IP_PUT_SP` — Pressure up throttle setpoint full-load row, interpolated onto the slot rpm axis. Per-rpm. | Solid line + shaded band above it |
| `BoostCurveModel.refusalCeilingPsi`  | The **scalar maximum** of that same row — what `switchpatch._check_below_base_ceiling` compares against. | Dashed error-coloured line   |

Between them lies a real region where an edit is **accepted and then ignored**:
the base caps the slot at that rpm, so the change never shows on a log. That band
is shaded and counted in words on the screen, because a silently ineffective
boost edit is the failure a person would otherwise diagnose from a datalog.

`maxSettablePsi` backs off one `PSI_STEP` below refusal. The engine's test is
`>=`, and psi is *floored* on its way to stored hPa, so any value strictly below
the ceiling in psi is also strictly below it in hPa — one step is sufficient,
not merely cautious. `BoostCurveTest` sweeps the drag range and asserts no
reachable fingertip position produces a cap the engine would refuse.

### Dragged values are clamped; typed values are refused

The distinction is deliberate and applies to both editors:

- A **drag** never stated an exact number, so snapping it into the legal range
  alters nothing anyone asked for.
- A **typed** number is a stated intent. Silently storing 20.99 for a typed 21.00
  would be this library's cardinal sin — quietly altering a value — committed one
  layer up. So typed entry is *validated* and the entry is left untouched with a
  message naming the ceiling.

### Edits are staged, and one deliberate change is one journal entry

A drag moves a local draft; **Apply** sends it as a single engine op. Continuous
committing would turn one gesture into dozens of journal entries and undo points,
on a bin that gets flashed to a real ECU. The table editor works the same way:
cell edits and the batch operations (fill / offset / scale / ramp) compose a
draft, and Apply sends one `paste` over the whole grid.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Switching slots with an unapplied draft is refused**, not auto-discarded. The
  alternative silently drops an edit on the way to another slot.
- **Undo and redo re-read whatever editor is open** (`refreshOpenViews`). Without
  it a grid would keep showing values the session no longer holds, and the diff
  someone reviewed before Apply would not be the diff they made.

### What each editor will not let you do

- A **non-reversible** table (non-linear scaling, or no embedded data) is
  presented read-only. `canApply` is gated on `reversible`, so a proposal that
  could only ever end in an engine refusal cannot be composed and sent.
- An **axis** edit that breaks strict monotonicity is refused at the keystroke.
  The engine enforces it regardless — this only makes the refusal arrive while
  the value is still on screen.
- **Restore** is a real `restore` op, never a local reset: only the journal knows
  what a table held at session start, and it is journaled like any other change
  so the build's byte audit can still explain it.

### One bridge op was added: `boost_rpm_axis`

The shared slot rpm axis is routed through `switchpatch.slot_rpm_axis` rather
than reached with the generic `edit` op, because only the domain call enforces
strictly-increasing breakpoints *and* checks the patch's separate axis-length
header. One axis serves all five slots, so a bad breakpoint reinterprets every
slot curve at once — silently, since the stored grids do not change.

Adding an op does **not** bump `BRIDGE_VERSION`: an older app never names it, and
a newer app against an older engine gets a clean `UNKNOWN_OP` rather than a field
read two different ways, which is what the version gate exists to prevent.

`simoscal.tune.catalog.TableInfo` also gained `is_axis`, so the editor can label
an axis and pre-validate it.

### Domain-owned tables are unreachable from the generic editor

Routing the rpm axis through its own op is not enough on its own: the generic
`edit` op could still reach the same table, and the five slot `PUT setpoint`
grids too. A `TableSpec` now carries an `owner` — the domain call that is the
only legitimate way to write it — and the whole switch-patch profile declares
one. Three things follow, and all three are engine-side:

- `apply_op()` refuses an owned table for **every** generic op, RESTORE included:
  a partial restore breaks the eight-row tiling exactly as a partial write does.
- `catalog()` omits owned tables, so the browser never offers a grid the engine
  will refuse. `table_detail` still reads them — reading was never the hazard.
- Every app build of a patched bin registers the switch-patch sanity gate, so the
  finished file is re-checked whether the session was created or recovered.

Without this, a one-cell edit to a slot grid — or a `12 → 13` write to the axis
length header — was accepted, then reported `verified=True` with a share path
(CR-20260813-01).

### Every table says what it is, and every axis says what it measures

An XDF axis carries breakpoints and a unit string. That decodes a table and does
not begin to label one: "4000" across the top of a grid is engine speed on
`IP_PQ_CHA_MAX` and turbocharger air mass flow on
`IP_PUT_AMP_DIF_MAX_PRS_DIF_THR`, and the screen said neither. Three pieces close
that, all engine-side so the app and any report describe a table the same way:

- **The parser keeps the axis link.** A breakpoint axis is stored once and shared
  by every table that uses it, and only that standalone table carries the axis's
  own A2L symbol. `Axis.link_uniqueid` now holds the `<embedinfo linkobjid>` that
  points at it. Metadata only — it names a sibling table and changes no decode.
- **`simoscal.tune.quantities` maps symbol → English**, curated the way the
  profile is: every entry was checked against its decoded breakpoints before
  being written down, and an axis with no entry falls back to its symbol rather
  than to a guess. Inferring the quantity from the *unit* was rejected outright —
  it is right most of the time, and the times it is wrong put the wrong name over
  the wrong column. `test_quantities.py` fails if a profile addition brings an
  uncurated axis with it.
- **`TableInfo.signature`** is the one-line "what is this table": `hPa vs. Engine
  speed [rpm] and Manifold pressure setpoint [hPa]`. `units_description` spells a
  bare XDF `-` as "dimensionless", which is a statement where a lone dash reads
  as missing metadata.

The editor prints the signature under the title, the x-axis label over the column
headers, and the y-axis label in the corner beside the rows; the edit dialog adds
the breakpoints the cell sits on, because indices identify a cell and only the
breakpoints say what operating point it governs.

### Numbers are formatted for the table they are in, never in exponent form

`%.6g` put `4.40536e-13` on screen for a y-axis breakpoint of exactly 0 °C — the
XDF's scaling equation evaluated in floating point, so the residue is the
arithmetic's and not the calibration's — and `3.10010` for a cell quantized to
1/4096. An exponent on a calibration screen is never information: it is either
noise dressed as a number or a real value made unreadable.

`ValueFormat` (`Formatting.kt`) replaces it. One precision is chosen for a whole
set and applied to all of it — the cells share one, each axis gets its own —
starting at roughly four significant digits of the largest value present, which
is what puts that residue back as `0.00` and a `79.9891` breakpoint back as the
`80` the calibrator meant. It is then *raised* until every meaningfully different
value in the set formats differently, and that guard is what makes the rounding
safe: a changed cell is drawn above its old value, and two different numbers
rendering identically would turn a real edit into an invisible one. Differences
below one part in a billion are excluded from that test, or a 6000-rpm axis would
chase residue in its twelfth digit forever.

The numeric dialog also asks the IME for `KeyboardType.Decimal` rather than
`Number`. `Number` requests digits only, and every value the dialog edits is a
Double — on the Tab A9+ that meant a cell holding `3.100097`, or a `0.05` Offset,
could not be typed at all, and Set stayed disabled because `toDoubleOrNull` never
saw a parseable string.

`Decimal` gets the decimal point and stops there: it never sets
`TYPE_NUMBER_FLAG_SIGNED`, Android has no signed-decimal input type, and Compose
exposes none — so the Tab A9+ keypad renders no `-` key at all. Ignition `°CRK`,
a downward Offset, and a sub-zero temperature breakpoint are all ordinary values
here, and none of them could be entered. Hence the **± button** beside the field,
which flips the sign of the text (`String.withFlippedSign`) and depends on no IME
behaviour whatsoever. It operates on text rather than a parsed Double so it works
mid-type — press ± on an empty field, then key the digits. Verified on the tablet:
`3.10009765625` → ± → `-3.10009765625`, with Set still enabled.

The edit dialog does **not** round. It seeds with `displayExact`, the shortest
fixed-point text that reads back within `CHANGE_EPSILON` — the same threshold
that decides whether a cell counts as changed. Were it looser, opening a cell and
pressing Set while changing nothing would manufacture a diff out of a rounding
step. Verified on the tablet: a `3.10009765625` cell opened and Set unchanged
still reports "0 changed".

## V9 — the per-slot switchboard

The switch patch is one shared tune plus a per-slot decision about which features
are on: **24 tables differ between map slots**, and until now the app exposed
exactly one of them (`PUT setpoint`, via the boost editor). Sixteen of the other
23 are 1×1 scalars, and the question they answer is comparative — "which slots
have launch control enabled" — which the generic table editor answers badly: you
open five tables, and the one you skipped is the one that surprises you in the
car. The **Slots** destination puts all five slots on one screen, one row per
setting.

### Sixteen settings, twelve of them writable

`SLOT_SETTINGS` in the switch-patch profile is one registry feeding two
consumers: it generates the `TableSpec`s *and* it is what the screen renders, so
a setting cannot be toggleable in the app and unmapped in the profile.
`test_every_switchboard_setting_is_mapped_and_owned` asserts the generation.

Twelve are 0/1 flags — SL TC, OEM TC, LC, NLS, RAL, pops, and six flex-fuel
modifier enables. The other four are **read, described, and refused**, and shown
anyway rather than hidden, because a screen listing twelve would be claiming the
patch has twelve per-slot settings:

| Setting | Why it has no write path |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RPM limiter` | Reads 0 in every slot of the as-patched bin, so what a non-zero value means — and whether 0 means "leave the OEM limiter alone" — is inferred, not established. Writing an uncharacterised override is how you get a rev limit you did not intend. |
| `Speed limiter` | Same: 0 everywhere, meaning of non-zero unestablished. |
| `Manual AFU` | Not a flag at all. A 0–1 fraction stored **/128**, so a "toggle" writes 128× what anyone meant. The XDF says it "only adjusts the value"; the patch's own logging category mentions "manual e content", so it is *probably* hand-set ethanol fraction — probably is not good enough for a fuel-composition input the engine trusts. |
| `Gauge settings (bitmask)` | No source we have says what any individual bit means, and a bitmask written as a whole number sets seven bits you did not choose. |

Tapping a row's name opens the description, the units, the caution, and — for
these four — the reason verbatim. `set_slot_flag()` refuses all four engine-side
regardless of what any UI does.

### Three refusals, not one

`switchpatch.set_slot_flag()` rejects an unknown key (a typo that wrote nothing
looks exactly like a flag that does not work), a non-flag or read-only setting,
and — the last line of defence — **a flag whose stored byte is neither 0 nor 1**.
These sixteen tables sit within a few bytes of each other, so a mis-bound
uniqueid lands on a neighbour holding something else; reading before writing is
what makes that a loud failure instead of a silent corruption. The tables are
`owner`-tagged like every other patch table, so the generic `edit` op cannot
reach them either.

### Toggles are not staged

Unlike the table and boost editors, there is no draft and no Apply. A flag has
two states and no shape to review, so an Apply step would gate the write on a
review of nothing. Each tap is one bridge call, one journal entry, one undo
point — which is the granularity a person actually wants to step back through.
Nothing flips optimistically: the reply carries the whole board and the grid
redraws from it, so a refused write never looked, even for a frame, like it
worked.

`refreshOpenViews()` re-reads the switchboard after undo/redo for the same
reason it re-reads the other editors. Caught on-device: before that, undoing a
toggle left the row still reading "on" — this screen's entire job is to say which
slots have a feature on, so being stale about that is being wrong about the only
thing it claims to know.

### What the switchboard does not cover

Seven per-slot tables remain unexposed: `Spark modifier` (16×16 °), `Lambda
modifier` (8×12), and five `Torque Request` maps (9×20 / 7×20 Nm). The two
modifiers are grids the generic editor could show if they were mapped; the torque
maps are held deliberately — 25 grids of 180 cells whose Type 1/2/3 semantics are
not established anywhere, and no revision in the lineage has touched them.
Offering a table this project cannot describe cuts against how the catalog is
built.

### What V8 still owes, and why it needs hardware

- Dragging on a real touchscreen: whether 12 breakpoints across a phone-width
  plot are separable by a fingertip, and whether the grab-at-touch-down rule
  feels right in practice.
- **No Compose screenshot tests.** The plan asks for light/dark screenshot tests;
  the pure state and coordinate math are covered instead. This is a known gap,
  carried over from V7's decision not to stand up a Compose test harness.
- ~~The on-device parity pull~~ — **done 2026-08-15**, see below.

### The on-device pull (2026-08-15)

The first bin this app ever produced, built on a Galaxy Tab A9+ from the R14
patched bin and exported through the share sheet, then verified on the desktop
against the app's own claims. **Not flashed** — this is a `TEST00` artifact.

The whole point is the *byte diff*, because it is the one thing the app cannot
grade itself on:

| Region       | Bytes | What it is                                                |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x27d71a`   | 192   | `slot5_put_setpoint` — the boost edit (8 × 12 int16)       |
| `0x200304`   | 4     | `CAL_CRC` stored value — the checksum correction           |
| everything else | 0  | byte-identical to the R14 source                          |

196 bytes in two contiguous runs, and nothing else in a 4 MB file. The edit is
map slot 5 flattened from 1705 hPa to **2050 hPa** (9.99 → 15.00 psi gauge),
tiled identically across all eight uncharacterized Y rows — the tiling invariant
holding through the domain call, on a phone. Slots 1–4 are untouched.

Re-checked on the exported file with desktop `simoscal`:

- `CAL_CRC` and `ECM3` both verify clean, neither stale;
- `ECM3`'s stored value correctly did **not** change — the edit at `0x27d71a`
  falls outside its covered range (`0x20DFAC`–`0x2101B0`), so an ECM3 delta here
  would have been the bug;
- `preflight`: `ok_to_edit=True`, `switch_patch_present=True`;
- `switch_patch_sanity`: `plausible=True`, 123 tables resolved, 123 decoded,
  0 decode errors.

Reaching this took three fixes found by running on hardware, all on the same
day: the bridge could not name a file to the engine at all (CR-20260815-01), the
build gate resolved a desktop-only BinToolz path so no patched bin could ever be
built on a device (CR-20260815-05), and an unreadable patch XDF was reported as
an absent patch, which cost three attempts to diagnose (CR-20260815-02). None of
the three was reachable from the host test suite.

**This is a different claim from the V0 parity gate below**, which ran
separately on the same tablet later that day. This run shows the app produces a
correct bin through its real workflow; the parity gate shows the engine computes
byte-identical results to the host across the payload's six legs. Both now hold
on physical hardware, but neither implies the other.

## V10 — the Changes screen

Until now the app could tell you what a *build* changed and nothing else. Every
edit vanished into the session the moment it was applied: the boost editor showed
the curve you now had, the table grid showed the values you now had, and the only
way to see the set of things you had done was to run a build and read its report.
That is the wrong order — Build is the gate you pass *after* reviewing, and there
was nowhere to review.

The **Changes** destination is that missing page: the session's edit journal,
re-read on every visit.

### It reads the engine's journal; it does not keep its own

`ChangesUiState` holds only what the `journal` op returned. The obvious cheaper
design — accumulate the `entry` each edit reply already carries — is wrong, and
undo is why. `History._restore` replaces the journal's entry list *wholesale*
from a snapshot rather than popping the last entry, so an app-side list would
still show an edit the session no longer holds. There is no reconciliation that
fixes this; the engine's copy is the only one that can be right.

That is also what makes the screen auto-update with no subscription and no
polling. Navigating away leaves the composition; coming back re-runs
`LaunchedEffect(sessionId)`, which calls `loadJournal()` unconditionally — not
gated on `loaded` the way `SlotsScreen` gates its one-time read, because a stale
list is this screen's failure mode rather than an acceptable cache.
`test_journal_follows_undo_and_redo` in the engine's suite is the property the
whole design rests on.

### It is a running list, never a report

The screen is styled after `render_report_html` — the same tally across the top,
the same "Needs your eyes" section lifting held-back entries out of the list
before the list, the same before → after cards, the same collapsed full journal,
the same colour meanings. One thing is deliberately **not** borrowed: the verdict
banner.

That banner speaks for checksums, readback, and the byte audit, and this screen
has run none of them. Re-deriving a verdict from a live journal is exactly the
drift `CR-20260724-02` closed, which is why `simoscal/bridge.py` has never
offered a `report` op and why the `journal` op returns no `verified` flag, no
gate rows, no checksum state and no share path —
`test_journal_carries_no_gate_verdict` asserts their absence on the wire. In
their place the screen carries a standing amber band saying the list is
unverified and that Build is what verifies it. Export still exists only in
`BuildState.Verified`, unchanged.

### Three distinctions the screen refuses to collapse

- **Applied is not the same as bytes moved.** A write whose target was already
  met stages nothing and is still `applied`. The headline figure counts
  `touched`, the engine's own measurement, so "3 edits moved bytes" cannot be
  inflated by writes that changed nothing.
- **Not read yet is not the same as nothing changed.** `loaded` is separate from
  `entries.isEmpty()`, because showing "No changes yet" while the read is in
  flight tells someone their edits are gone.
- **A failed refresh is not an empty list.** `failed()` keeps the previous
  entries and adds a notice. Blanking them would replace a stale answer with a
  confident wrong one about the thing the person is about to flash.

An unknown verdict — a newer engine against an older app — parses to
`Verdict.UNKNOWN` and is never rendered as applied or counted as a change, the
same rule `SettingKind.UNKNOWN` follows on the slots screen.

### Still owed

On-device: the tab is host-verified only (226 unit tests, `assembleDebug` green).
The five-item navigation bar and the collapsed journal at a real recipe's entry
count have not been looked at on the tablet.

## V0 verdict: CLOSED — arm64 PASS (2026-08-15/16), x86_64 dropped rather than proven

### Physical arm64 — Galaxy Tab A9+ (`SM-X210`, Android 16, `arm64-v8a`)

```
host   digest: 9e6ee056b54dda3352b3049795c3e855e14b7810072e6652b63045d4d8e9719c
device digest: 9e6ee056b54dda3352b3049795c3e855e14b7810072e6652b63045d4d8e9719c
PARITY: MATCH — host and device agree on every compared field.
```

`diff_count: 0`, digests self-consistent on both sides, and **zero `SKIPPED`
occurrences anywhere in the report** — so every leg ran and was compared,
including the boost leg (its switch-patch fixtures were pushed). Same digest as
the host and the emulator, which makes three-way agreement: desktop, emulator,
and real hardware compute the same bytes.

The host golden was regenerated from current source immediately beforehand and
produced that same digest, so the day's three engine fixes (CR-20260815-01, -05,
-06 and the -02 message change) are demonstrably parity-neutral.

`parity/v0_device_report.json` in this repo is now the physical run, and its diff
against the emulator run it replaced is the design working as intended: the only
changed lines are `platform` (`Android-15` → `Android-16`) and the four
`timings`. Those are exactly the two sections the report holds outside the
compared digest. Everything compared is byte-identical between an emulator and a
real tablet.

Measured on the tablet, informational and deliberately outside the compared
section — a slow phone must not fail the gate:

| Metric                    | Emulator | Physical A9+ |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Full-XDF parse (5.8 MB)   | 1.9 s    | **6.7 s**    |
| Decode all 3,814 tables   | 0.17 s   | **0.53 s**   |
| Edit + save + checksum    | 0.21 s   | **0.42 s**   |
| `slot_curve()` boost edit | 1.96 s   | **7.0 s**    |

Runtime: Python 3.13.9, numpy 1.26.2, `Android-16-aarch64-64bit-ELF`. The tablet
is roughly 3.5× slower than the emulator, which is the number to design waits
around: parse and boost edit are each ~7 s, long enough that preflight reads as
a hang without a spinner.

### Re-proven against the shipping APK (2026-08-16)

The APK measured above was the two-ABI build. Dropping x86_64 changed the
shipping artifact, so the verdict was re-taken rather than inherited: rebuilt
arm64-only, reinstalled both APKs on the same tablet, and re-ran the
instrumentation. Same digest `9e6ee056…`, `diff_count: 0`, `digests_self_consistent`
on both sides, and all seven report steps carried real content — `boost_curve`
included, which is the leg that goes `{"skipped": …}` when its fixtures are
missing. 109 unit tests and the no-permissions gate green, and
`unzip -l … | grep x86` returns nothing.

### x86_64: dropped, not proven

x86_64 parity was the last leg owed for V0, and it is now moot because the ABI is
gone from `abiFilters`. The reasoning, recorded here because the alternative was
half-built:

The leg cannot run on this machine. The Apple-silicon Android emulator ships
`qemu-system-aarch64` and `qemu-system-armel` and **no x86_64 backend** in either
SDK install (`~/Library/Android/sdk`, `/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools`),
so an x86_64 system image has nothing to boot on no matter which images are
installed. A GitHub Actions workflow on a Linux x86_64 runner was written and its
host half passed, then abandoned: it buys a proof for an architecture nobody here
runs, and pays a permanent second CI path for it. The target device is arm64.

So the honest close is to stop making the claim rather than to keep shipping an
unverified one. **Re-adding `x86_64` to `abiFilters` re-opens the parity question**
and must not be done without running the leg on a real x86_64 host.

### Arm64 emulator (2026-07-23)

On a `Pixel 6 / API 35 / arm64` emulator, the embedded Chaquopy engine produced a
parity report whose compared digest is **byte-for-byte identical** to the host
golden:

```
host digest:   9e6ee056b54dda3352b3049795c3e855e14b7810072e6652b63045d4d8e9719c
device digest: 9e6ee056b54dda3352b3049795c3e855e14b7810072e6652b63045d4d8e9719c
PARITY: MATCH — host and device agree on every compared field.
```

That means, across all 3,814 tables decoded, the single-cell edit
(`IP_PUT_SP` — Pressure up throttle setpoint, 1500 hPa → encoded
1499.9780270084689), both checksum verdicts, the psi→hPa floor (10 psi → 1705
hPa), and the `slot_curve()` boost edit, **the arm64 emulator computes the same
bytes as the desktop.** This was the provisional GO for implementation; the
physical-arm64 leg above has since closed, and x86_64 was dropped rather than
proven — so this is now the earliest of three agreeing arm64 results, not a
partial gate.

Measurements (emulator, arm64):

| Metric                     | Value                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Runtime                    | Python 3.13.9, numpy 1.26.2, Android 15  |
| Full-XDF parse (5.8 MB)    | ~1.9 s                                   |
| Decode all 3,814 tables    | ~0.17 s                                  |
| Edit + save + checksum     | ~0.21 s                                  |
| `slot_curve()` boost edit  | ~1.96 s                                  |
| APK size (arm64 + x86_64)  | 54 MB (V0-era, pre-Compose — see § V7 for current) |

All well within the "tolerable on your own phone in a garage" bar the plan set.
Cold-start remains to be measured; x86_64 parity no longer applies.

## The gate, in one sentence

`simoscal_v0_parity.run_parity()` is imported by *both* the host runner and the
on-device instrumentation test, each writes a report, and the reports' compared
sections must be identical — one sha256 either matches or it does not.

The report deliberately splits in two. `environment` and `timings` are
**informational**: the Python build, ABI, and wall-clock are *expected* to differ
between a Mac and a phone, and comparing them would fail the gate for the wrong
reason. Everything else is compared exactly.

What it exercises, and why each is the narrowest thing that could break:

| Leg           | What would break if a runtime differed                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parse`       | 5.8 MB XML → table model                                    |
| `enumerate`   | numpy decode math over all 3,814 tables                     |
| `edit_and_save` | inverse scaling, minimal-diff writer, checksum correction |
| `readback`    | what actually landed on disk, reopened from scratch         |
| `psi_floor`   | psi→hPa **floors, never rounds up** (boost safety property) |
| `boost_curve` | `slot_curve()` incl. the below-base-ceiling guard           |

A skipped leg is recorded **inside the compared section**, so a host golden that
ran the boost leg cannot silently "match" a device run that skipped it.

## Running the host half

```bash
cd Code
./.venv313/bin/python android/parity/run_host_parity.py --out android/parity/golden_host.json
```

Must run on **Python 3.13** (the version Chaquopy embeds); the runner refuses a
mismatch rather than producing a golden that answers the wrong question.

Verified host results (2026-07-23, Python 3.13.14, numpy 2.5.1):

- digest stable across repeated runs (byte-identical reports)
- `IP_PUT_SP` — Pressure up throttle setpoint: requested 1500 hPa → encoded
  1499.9780270084689, and read back off the saved file as exactly that
- `CAL_CRC` and `ECM3` both verify clean after correction
- 10.0 psi → **1705 hPa** floored, matching the documented `slot_curve` contract
- source bin sha256 unchanged by the run (immutable-source rule holds)
- comparator proven in both directions: a tampered field is caught and named

## Running the device half

This is the sequence that actually worked on a physical tablet (2026-08-15).
`parity/push_fixtures_and_compare.sh` wraps the first and last steps.

```bash
export BOOST_FIXTURE_DIR=/path/to/switch-patch-xdf-and-patched-bin
cd parity && ./push_fixtures_and_compare.sh push   # all four fixtures

cd ..
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
./gradlew :engine:assembleDebug :engine:assembleDebugAndroidTest
adb install -r -g engine/build/outputs/apk/debug/engine-debug.apk
adb install -r -g engine/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/engine-debug-androidTest.apk

adb shell am instrument -w -e fixtureDir /data/local/tmp/v0 \
  com.simoscal.engine.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner   # → OK (2 tests)

cd parity && ./push_fixtures_and_compare.sh compare
```

Fixtures are **not committed** — the repo gitignores `*.bin` and `*.xdf`. Two
of the four come from a `simoscal` checkout (`SIMOSCAL_DIR`); the other two, the
switch-patch XDF and the patched bin, are supplied locally (`BOOST_FIXTURE_DIR`)
because one is third-party and the other is a specific car's calibration.
Absent fixtures make the test *skip*, matching the repo-wide convention for
tests that touch the real bin/XDF. A skipped leg is recorded
inside the compared section, so a host golden that ran the boost leg cannot
silently "match" a device run that skipped it — check the report has zero
`SKIPPED` before believing a MATCH.

### Play Protect blocks the test APK on a stock device

**The first install of `com.simoscal.engine.test` will hang, not fail.** Google
Play Protect refuses it with an on-device dialog:

> **Unsafe app blocked** — `com.simoscal.engine.test`
> This app was built for an older version of Android and doesn't include the
> latest privacy protections.

`adb install` blocks on the verifier's verdict, which never arrives while the
dialog sits unanswered — so it looks like a hung install, with no error, until
whatever timeout kills it. The dialog can easily be on a screen nobody is
looking at.

The objection was `targetSdk 33`. **This should no longer occur** — targetSdk is
35 as of 2026-08-20 (see the pin note below) — but the workaround is kept here
because it was never re-tested against a stock device after the bump, and because
the same dialog appears for any package Play Protect has not seen before. It bit
the *test* APK and not the app APK
only because the app package is usually already installed, making its installs
*updates*; the block applies to new packages.

```bash
adb shell settings put global verifier_verify_adb_installs 0   # before the first install
adb shell settings delete global verifier_verify_adb_installs  # restore afterwards
```

Scoped to adb sideloads and nothing else. Only needed once per package: after
`com.simoscal.engine.test` exists, rebuilds are updates and install normally, so
put the setting back. **The V0 gate was therefore not runnable on a stock
consumer device without either this setting or a `targetSdk` bump** — worth
knowing for a gate whose entire purpose is physical hardware. The bump has since
happened; whether that alone is now sufficient is untested.

### `connectedAndroidTest` still reports `tests=0`

Reconfirmed on the A9+ on 2026-08-15: `./gradlew :engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
builds and installs both APKs, runs nothing, and fails the build. The JUnit XML
it leaves behind says so plainly:

```xml
<testsuite tests="0" failures="0" errors="0" skipped="0" ...>
```

Read the XML before believing the verdict in either direction — a red Gradle
build here is not a failing test, and it is certainly not a parity result. Use
`am instrument` (above) or Android Studio's green ▶.

### Running the device half against the *minified release* build

The sequence above builds `debug`, which has R8 off — so it exercises none of the
keeps in `engine/proguard-rules.pro` and proves nothing about the artifact that
ships. `testBuildType` is `debug` by default for exactly that reason; pass
`-PtestReleaseBuild` to point the instrumented suite at the release variant
instead. Needs release signing material (see "Release builds").

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
./gradlew :engine:assembleRelease :engine:assembleReleaseAndroidTest \
  -PtestReleaseBuild -Psimoscal.dir=/Users/sam/SimosTools/Code
adb install -r engine/build/outputs/apk/release/engine-release.apk
adb install -r engine/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/release/engine-release-androidTest.apk
adb shell am instrument -w -r \
  com.simoscal.engine.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner   # -> OK (2 tests)
```

`connectedAndroidTest` reports `tests=0` here too — same flake as above, so drive
it with `am instrument` and read that output, not Gradle's exit code.

Confirmed 2026-08-20 on the arm64 API-35 emulator (`v0_arm64`): **OK (2 tests)**,
with logcat showing `libpython3.13.so`, `libchaquopy_java.so` and the bootstrap
extension modules (`zlib`, `_ctypes`, `_struct`) loading under R8. That is the
direct evidence that the Chaquopy keeps hold — the failure mode they guard
against is a green build whose interpreter dies on device.

#### Why this needs two extra rule files

Running instrumented tests against a minified app breaks three times before it
works, and each break is in the *test harness*, not the app:

| Symptom                                              | Cause                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R8 "Missing class `...errorprone...MustBeClosed`"     | compile-only annotation on androidx.test's `Tracer`                   |
| `NoClassDefFoundError: androidx.tracing.Trace`        | on the *app's* classpath, unused by the app, so R8 strips it — but the runner shares the app's classloader |
| `NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin.LazyKt`                 | androidx.test resolves Kotlin stdlib members out of the app's dex      |
| `NoSuchFieldError: No field INSTANCE ... La3/e;`      | R8 renamed `SimoscalBridge`; the test APK still binds the source name  |

The fixes live in two files, deliberately **not** in `proguard-rules.pro`:

- `engine/proguard-rules-androidTest.pro` — via `testProguardFiles`, applies to
  the androidTest APK only.
- `engine/proguard-rules-releasetest.pro` — app-side keeps, added **only** when
  `-PtestReleaseBuild` is set, so a shipping `assembleRelease` / `bundleRelease`
  is byte-for-byte unchanged by any of this.

The cost of that gate, stated plainly: the APK the suite exercises is not
byte-identical to the one that ships. The delta is confined to `androidx.tracing`,
the Kotlin stdlib, and the two bridge class names — none of which touch the
`com.chaquo.python` keeps the suite exists to prove.

## Build path (what actually worked)

Generate the `gradlew` wrapper once via **Android Studio** (open this repo root,
choose **Use Android Studio's SDK** at the prompt, let the sync finish, dismiss
any "update AGP / migrate Gradle" nudges). From then on the CLI works:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
./gradlew :engine:connectedAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.fixtureDir=/data/local/tmp/v0
```

### The version pin that matters: Gradle 8.4, narrowly

**AGP 8.1.4 + Gradle 8.4 + compileSdk 35**, pinned in the build files. Moved up
on 2026-08-20 from AGP 7.4.2 + Gradle 7.6.4 + compileSdk 33 to reach the
`targetSdk` Play requires.

The old pin's reasoning was that Chaquopy 17.0.0's Python tasks read from the
JNI-libs and asset directories without declaring dependencies on the AGP tasks
that write there, and that **Gradle 8.0 turned that class of undeclared
dependency into a hard build failure**. The first half is still true. The second
half was measured on Gradle **9.3.0 and 8.11.1** and generalised to "8.0+", which
turns out to be too broad: **Gradle 8.4 builds through the same edges cleanly** —
`check` (334 tests across both variants), `assembleRelease` and `bundleRelease`
all pass, with every `generate*Python*` and `installPythonRequirements` task
running. Gradle tightened that validation across the 8.x line, so 8.4 sits in a
window that later 8.x versions close.

So this is a narrow pin. **Do not bump Gradle past 8.4 without re-running the
Chaquopy Python tasks.** That failure mode is a build error rather than a silent
one, so it will announce itself — but it will announce itself to whoever bumps
it. `org.gradle.parallel` and `org.gradle.caching` stay OFF (see
gradle.properties); that is part of what keeps 8.4 tolerant of these edges.

Staying on AGP 7.4 and only raising compileSdk was tried first and is a dead end:
aapt2 from AGP 7.4 cannot parse `android-35`'s resource table at all —

```
aapt2 E LoadedArsc.cpp:94] RES_TABLE_TYPE_TYPE entry offsets overlap actual entry data.
error: failed to load include path .../platforms/android-35/android.jar
```

— and `android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk` does not help, because this is a
parse failure rather than a version check.

### targetSdk 35 is behaviour-preserving on purpose

Android 15 stops insetting the window for apps targeting 35: system bars go
transparent, content draws behind them, and the theme's `statusBarColor` /
`navigationBarColor` are ignored. This app has **no window-insets handling
anywhere**, and its landscape layout deliberately drops the top app bar — the one
component that would have consumed the top inset — so enforcement would put the
boost canvas and its action row under the system bars.

`res/values-v35/themes.xml` therefore sets
`android:windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement`. The bump exists to satisfy Play's
minimum, and pairing a compliance change with an unverified layout change would
smuggle a regression in behind it.

**This is a hold, not a resting place.** The opt-out is deprecated and stops
working at targetSdk 36 — roughly one annual Play deadline away. Handling
`WindowInsets` in the Compose shell, and verifying both orientations on the
tablet, has to happen before that bump. Delete `values-v35/themes.xml` as part of
that work, not before it.

### Gradle `connectedAndroidTest` orchestration flake

`./gradlew :engine:connectedAndroidTest` built and packaged both APKs correctly
but its *connected-run step* reported `tests=0` / "failing tests" — an
install/run orchestration flake, **not** a real test failure. Installing the two
built APKs and running the instrumentation directly passes cleanly:

```bash
ADB="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb"
APK=engine/build/outputs/apk
"$ADB" install -r -g "$APK/debug/engine-debug.apk"
"$ADB" install -r -g "$APK/androidTest/debug/engine-debug-androidTest.apk"
"$ADB" shell am instrument -w -e fixtureDir /data/local/tmp/v0 \
  com.simoscal.engine.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
# → OK (1 test); report at /sdcard/Android/data/com.simoscal.engine/files/
```

Then `parity/push_fixtures_and_compare.sh compare` pulls the report and diffs it
against the host golden. Running the test from Android Studio's green ▶ is the
GUI equivalent and also works. The flake is worth revisiting but did not block the
gate.

## Release builds

Debug builds are unchanged. The `release` build type adds R8 shrinking and
requires a signing key, and both of those decisions have a way to bite that is
worth reading before you use them.

### The keystore never lives in this repo

`keystore.properties` at the repo root (gitignored, alongside `*.jks` /
`*.keystore`), or the equivalent environment variables:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ~/keys/simoscal-upload.jks \
  -alias simoscal-upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000

SIMOSCAL_STORE_FILE=~/keys/simoscal-upload.jks SIMOSCAL_STORE_PASSWORD=... \
SIMOSCAL_KEY_ALIAS=simoscal-upload SIMOSCAL_KEY_PASSWORD=... \
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17 \
./gradlew :engine:bundleRelease -Psimoscal.dir=/Users/sam/SimosTools/Code
```

Two refusals guard this, in the same spirit as the permission gate:
half-configured signing material throws at configuration time rather than
falling back, and `assembleRelease` / `bundleRelease` refuse outright when there
is no material at all. AGP's own default is to emit an *unsigned* release and
report success, which is exactly the quiet failure this project does not accept.
A clone with no keystore still configures, builds debug, and runs `check`.

### R8 rules are load-bearing, not boilerplate

`engine/proguard-rules.pro` keeps `com.chaquo.python.**` in full. Chaquopy ships
as a plain JAR (`chaquopy_java-17.0.0.jar`), **not** an AAR, so it contributes no
consumer ProGuard rules — nothing keeps it but that file — and its native layer
resolves those classes from C over JNI, with `Reflector`,
`PyInvocationHandler`, `DynamicProxy` and `StaticProxy` existing only to proxy
calls reflectively. R8 sees no Java caller for most of it. Strip it and the
build still goes green; the interpreter then fails to start on the device, and
`SimoscalBridge` reports it only as "The embedded calibration engine could not
start."

What makes this survivable at all is that the bridge crosses into Python by
*module-name string* and returns JSON — Python never names a Kotlin class — so
obfuscating the app's own code is safe. That property is worth preserving: if
Python is ever given a Kotlin class to name, it needs a keep rule the same day.

Verify the rules held by checking that nothing was renamed, rather than assuming:

```bash
grep -E "^com\.chaquo\.python" engine/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt \
  | awk -F' -> ' '$1 != substr($2,1,length($2)-1)'   # must print nothing
```

Upload `engine/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt` to Play so crash
traces de-obfuscate.

### Measured on 2026-08-20

APK 39 MB debug → 32 MB release; AAB 25 MB; arm64-v8a only; not debuggable; no
`.bin` or `.xdf` anywhere in the package. The permission gate runs on the
release variant too (`engine/build/reports/permissions/release.txt`).

### Licensing, and why it is GPL-3.0

The APK embeds the `simoscal` Python library, which is GPL-3.0. Shipping it
inside a distributed binary makes the binary a conveyed work, so this app takes
the same licence — a consequence of the dependency, not a preference. `LICENSE`
is the GPL-3.0 text (byte-identical to simoscal's), and `LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY`
covers Chaquopy, CPython, NumPy, AndroidX/Compose/Kotlin and org.json.

Anyone who receives the APK is entitled to the corresponding source; both repos
being public is what satisfies that.

Known inconsistency, in the *other* repo: `simoscal`'s `pyproject.toml` declares
`license = { text = "Proprietary" }` while its LICENSE file and GitHub both say
GPL-3.0. The metadata is the thing that is wrong, and it should be corrected
there before either repo is held up as the source offer.

### Store-listing paperwork

- `docs/privacy-policy.md` — the policy text, and **only** the policy text. It
  is written to be published verbatim, so keep internal guidance out of it; the
  notes that used to sit at its head and foot are reproduced below instead.
  Play requires it at a stable public URL, and requires the contact route in it
  to stay monitored — an unreachable contact is treated as a policy problem, not
  an oversight. There are no placeholders left to fill: `80d3ced` settled the
  publisher as *the simoscal project* and the contact as the project gmail.
- `docs/play-data-safety.md` — every Data safety answer with the evidence in
  this repo that makes it true, so it can be re-verified per submission rather
  than copied forward. Short version: nothing is collected, because there is no
  network permission to collect it with.

#### Who Google makes public, by account type

This is not a privacy-policy question — the policy names no individual — but
Google asks the same question elsewhere, and the account type decides how much
of the answer becomes public.

A **personal** account displays the developer's legal name, the *country* from
the legal address, and the developer email. The **full address is published only
if the app monetizes** — a free app with no ads and no in-app purchases, which
this is, shows country alone.

An **organization** account publishes the organization's legal name, **full
legal address**, developer email and phone. It also requires a D-U-N-S number,
and therefore a registered entity. For a solo project this is the *worse* option
for address privacy, not the better one: it publishes a street address that the
personal route does not.

So the residual public exposure on the personal route is the legal name, not an
address. The trade runs the other way on schedule, though: personal accounts
created after 2023-11-13 must run a closed test with 12 testers opted in for 14
continuous days before they can apply for production access, and organization
accounts are exempt. Verify both against Play Console's current requirements
before submitting — they change.

### Play-uploadability

`targetSdk` is 35 as of 2026-08-20, which clears the blocker that made this
unuploadable. Confirmed on the built artifact rather than in the build file:

```
$ aapt dump badging engine/build/outputs/apk/release/engine-release.apk
package: name='com.simoscal.engine' versionCode='1' versionName='0.1.0' ...
sdkVersion:'26'
targetSdkVersion:'35'
native-code: 'arm64-v8a'
```

Check Play's current minimum before submitting — it rises annually, around
August, and the value that mattered when this was written may not be the value
that matters when you upload.

What remains is not build work: a hosted privacy-policy URL, the Data safety
form, content rating, and the store listing itself — see *Store-listing
paperwork* above.

## Environment / toolchain

Installed on this machine while setting up: `openjdk@17`
(`/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`, keg-only — `~/.zshrc` was **not** modified),
`android-commandlinetools` and **Android Studio** (which adopted its own SDK at
`~/Library/Android/sdk` — platform 33 & 35, build-tools, platform-tools, emulator,
`system-images;android-35;google_apis;arm64-v8a`), `python@3.13`, and `gradle`.
An AVD named `v0_arm64` (Pixel 6 / API 35 / arm64) exists. `~/.zshrc` was not
modified; `JAVA_HOME` is set per-invocation.

## V11 — the analysis battery on the phone

The other half of the tuning loop. Everything before this unit helps someone
*write* a calibration; this one reads the datalogs that say whether the last one
worked, on the same tablet, without a laptop in the loop.

Reachable from the landing screen and from the navigation bar, and gated on
nothing: `analyze_logs` opens no session, holds no bin, and writes no file, so
requiring a session would be a gate with no safety behind it.

### The plots are series, not pictures — and why that is the honest port

matplotlib is deliberately outside the mobile dependency closure (see the `pip`
block in `engine/build.gradle.kts`: core deps are numpy-only, which is what keeps
matplotlib and openpyxl out of the APK). So the phone cannot render the library's
own evidence PNGs and has to draw its own.

That is where a feature like this usually goes wrong. The moment the Kotlin side
decides *which channel belongs on which panel*, the app and the desktop report
start describing the same log differently, and the battery stops being the
identical, enumerable thing its whole design rests on. So the inventory moved
into data instead:

- **`simoscal/analysis/series.py`** declares every rpm-axis evidence plot — its
  panels, each panel's series and their roles, its threshold lines, and the
  prose printed above it — as `PLOT_SPECS`, and nowhere else.
- **`evidence.py` renders those declarations** to PNG. The seven imperative
  plotter functions are gone; `_render_plot_spec` walks the spec.
- **`bridge.analyze_logs` serializes the same declarations** to JSON, using the
  *same* `series_segments()` the PNG writer uses, so the masking, the splitting
  at mask holes, and the rpm sort all happen once.
- **Kotlin draws marks and nothing else.** `AnalysisCanvas` maps role → ink and
  tone → colour; it never picks a channel.

`test_plot_payload_matches_the_png_inventory` pins the join: whatever the
payload calls drawn is exactly what the desktop renderer writes a file for.

The refactor was checked for drift rather than assumed safe. Rendering
`Logs/BasicsGuide_R14/` before and after, **six of the seven PNGs are
byte-identical** and the findings JSON is identical. The seventh
(`rail_pressure`) differs only in the HPFP threshold line's width, 0.9 → 1.0:
every other "high" threshold in the battery was already 1.0, and the tone
taxonomy that now crosses to the app has three levels, not a per-line width.
That was confirmed to be the *only* difference by re-rendering with the width
forced back.

### What the screen shows

Plots are presented **in alphabetical order by id** — boost, ignition, knock,
lambda, rail pressure, turbo heat, wastegate — always the same order whatever
the log held, so the screen is a list someone can learn rather than one that
reshuffles with the data.

Each plot carries a description above it (what is plotted) and a tip below it
(what to notice). Both come from `PLOT_SPECS`, so the app and any future report
describe a plot in the same words. The encoding they all share is explained once
in a standing "How to read these" panel rather than seven times: solid coloured
is measured, dashed grey is what the ECU asked for, faint dots are transients the
lines exclude, and horizontal dashed lines are *this tool's* watch and high
thresholds, not limits the ECU enforces.

### Three decisions worth knowing

- **A pull's colour is assigned by the engine, not the app.** The payload carries
  an `ordinal` per series. Re-deriving it on the phone would let a pull that
  contributed nothing to one panel shift every later pull's colour on that panel
  alone, and "the blue curve" has to mean the same run across every plot.
- **Thinning keeps extremes, never a stride.** A three-minute log puts more
  samples behind a curve than a phone has pixels. `thinForDisplay` buckets and
  emits each bucket's min and max, because a single-sample knock spike is exactly
  what a stride would drop and exactly what the plot exists to show.
- **The bin is optional and never borrowed from the open session.** The two
  calibration-aware checks compare a log against the ceilings of the bin that was
  *flashed when it was recorded*; the bin someone is editing is the next
  calibration, not that one. Silently using it would produce a confident wrong
  answer, so the screen asks for it separately and says why.

### Verifying this unit

```bash
# engine half, from the simoscal checkout
Code/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_series.py tests/test_bridge.py -q

# app half
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
./gradlew :engine:testDebugUnitTest -Psimoscal.dir=/Users/sam/SimosTools/Code
```

`engine/src/test/resources/analysis_result.json` is a fixture **the engine
itself produced** (regenerate with `parity/gen_analysis_fixture.py`), so
`AnalysisModelTest` checks the parser against the real wire format rather than
against a hand-written guess — the same gap `VerifiedParamsTest` exists to close.

### Not on the phone

The two per-file time-axis plots (`overview`, `tc_activity`) stay desktop-only.
They are whole-log panel stacks against time with shaded pull windows, they carry
no `plot_ref` on any finding, and they remain imperative in `evidence.py`. Adding
them is a further unit, not a gap in this one.

## Ordering note — V1 came before V0, necessarily

The plan lists V1 (portable package boundary) as depending on V0. In practice the
dependency is the other way round: V0 cannot run at all until the engine imports
without matplotlib, because `simoscal/__init__.py` eagerly imported `.export`
(openpyxl) and `.plot` (matplotlib). So V1's decoupling was done first:

- `simoscal/__init__.py` now resolves the export/plot names lazily (PEP 562
  `__getattr__`), and raises an ImportError naming the missing extra rather than
  a bare "No module named matplotlib".
- `simoscal/tune/pipeline.py` imports `compare_tables` inside the one function
  that renders PNGs, so building/verifying/auditing a bin needs no matplotlib.
- `pyproject.toml` core deps are now **numpy-only**, with `plot`, `export`,
  `desktop`, and `dev` extras.

Verified: with `matplotlib` and `openpyxl` forced to fail on import, `import
simoscal` and `import simoscal.tune` both succeed, a real XDF/bin parses and
decodes, and checksums verify — with matplotlib never imported. Full suite: **554
passed**.

What remains of V1 for its own unit: installed-wheel packaging tests. The
`simoscal.analysis` half of the decoupling is **done** — `evidence.py` imports
matplotlib lazily inside `_figure()`, and V11 above proves it end-to-end by
running the whole analysis battery through `dispatch()` with matplotlib forced
to fail on import.
